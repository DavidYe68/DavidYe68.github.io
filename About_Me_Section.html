        <h3>Hello! I'm David Ye</h3>
        <p>I am a freshman studying Sociology with a passion for the intersection of society and technology(AI). My study focuses on Social Theories, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).</p>

          <li>AI and Social Dynamics</li>
          <li>Online Communities and Digital Culture</li>
